        <h1>Cellular Automata</h1>
        <p>"Cellular Automata" is a simple model of computation that can be used to simulate complex systems. It is a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of a finite number of states. The state of each cell is determined by the states of its neighbors according to a set of rules. The rules can be simple or complex, and can be applied in parallel or sequentially. Cellular Automata can be used to model a wide variety of systems, including physical, biological, and social systems. They have been used to study phenomena such as pattern formation, self-organization, and emergent behavior.</p>
